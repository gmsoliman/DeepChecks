# Hello! And Welcome to Deep Checks
Deep Checks is a .NET Web MVC designed to help users create regular, structured conversations with people they have relationships with, from partners, to coworkers, to roommates. The premise is that users schedule up regular times to have a structured conversations (or a Deep Check) with the each other. This could be as often as once a week or once a month. The important thing is to make sure that the frequency is often enough for both parties to feel regularly heard but not so frequent that it is difficult to maintain.

Users prepare their thoughts ahead of time for conversations around three categories: things I'm doing well, things you're doing well, and things I need more of. They then take turns sharing their points, and then mirror what the other person has said as closely to their words as possible.

This application can not only be used to structure these conversations, but to also record the user's Relationships, Deep Checks, and Entries that they wish to keep track of. This serves as a reference point for both participants to celebrate how well they've maintained a healthy relationship and allows them to remind themselves of how they can continually be even better for each other and the health of their relationship.

## Using the App
If you'd like to take Deep Checks for a spin, you can do so through one of two methods. You can clone the repository to your local Visual Studio Code and run the application locally, or you can access the deployed version on [Azure](https://deepcheckswebmvc.azurewebsites.net/).
